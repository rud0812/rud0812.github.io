<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
  I spent the last ~2 years working as a Business Transformation Consultant for EY in the Financial Services Industry. Projects ranged from M&A implementation of bank operations to creating Data Governance models. Dutties mainly involved providing frameworks, project management skills and industry knowledge to stakeholders and other high executives to effectively implement multi-million business transformation projects and/or strategies.

I learned several programming languages in college and graduate school but I'm mostly proficient in Python. I enjoy comming up with different ways of looking at Data and spend my time learning new ML Algorithms and doing Kaggle Competitions.

I enjoy reading and watching movies/tv shows. Main topics include macroeconomics, history, AI and Star Wars. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this is the main reason I named my website The Rise of AGI. I'll come up with new and better puns in the future lol.

Also, I'm a huge fan of sports and specifically soccer (Big Man Utd fan #GGMU). I played the soccer all my life and even got to play in a highly competitive level. Now, I spend my day watching the Premier League and UCL. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD">Friends of Tracking</a> have been a huge inspiration for the creation of this website, so I will definetly be doing some cool soccer analytics projects based on their research.
