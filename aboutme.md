    Hi, my name is <strong>Rodolfo Castro</strong> and I enjoy learning new things and coding fun projects.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
    I currently work as a Data Engineer at SCRM by Lidl in Barcelona, Spain. I'm new in the field so I'm learning new things every day. Before being a Data Engineer, I was a Business Consultant for EY in Panama. 
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
    I obtained my <strong>Bachelor's</strong> degree in Industrial Engineering from Florida State University. After, I obtained a <strong>Master's</strong> degree in Mathematical and Computational Finance from University of North Carolina at Charlotte and I'm currently doing my second <strong>Master's</strong> degree in Data Science at Universitat de Barcelona.
</p>

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
    I learned several programming languages in college and graduate school but I'm mostly proficient in Python. Currently, I've been learining Scala since my job as a Data Engineer requieres it because all the Data Infrastructure is built on top of it. Also, have become proficient in SQL (and Spark) from handling data all day long.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
    I enjoy reading and watching movies/tv shows. Main topics include macroeconomics, history, AI, Sci-fi and Star Wars. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this is the main reason I named my website The Rise of AGI. I'll come up with new and better puns in the future.
